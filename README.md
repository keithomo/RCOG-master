Radio Frequency Interference Characterization On GUPPI

RCOG is a program that was developed by Keith Omogrosso in August 2016 at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank, WV. This program is designed to take binary data from the Green Bank Telescope digital backend GUPPI and perform statistics to characterize RFI observed. This program uses GPU programming to utilize NVIDIA GPUs as the computational horse power for performing these statistics. Further work needs to be done to implement this code with the current digital back end of the Green Bank Telescope VEGAS in order to automatically and systematically remove RFI at the early stages of digital Processing to maximize the clarity of the data for the scientis in question who is observing. This program is primarily a proof of concept that RFI can be characterized in better than real time  (about 7 times faster than real time) with (kurtosis) and (mean/rms - 1). This program was used in conjunction with a python script that was developed as a project for an eager high school student Ellie White to prove that RCCOG does generate statistics that accurately characterize RFI in 100% of the cases tried. Let it be known that I am not claiming either of these two programs will identify RFI for 100% of the time, for not all types of RFI were studied in this experiement. However, this is a promising stepping stone to proving such a claim if more work was done.
